Agent Oriented Programming
==========================

1. EverythingIsAnAgent

2. Agent communicate by sending and receiving messages (the way they prefer as long as they send messages).

3. Agent have their own memory and autonomy

4. Every Agent is an instance of an artifact (which then as to be accounted as an agent).

5. The Agent is accountable for maintaining its consistency as a state/transition agent

6. The topology is more important than the code.

7. each state machine is on a plane for which an uncoupled state machine lays.

8. violation of uncoupling between layers is bad so it has to be handled with care.
