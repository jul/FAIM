NAME
    processes - Plugin to monitor processes and process states.

ABOUT
    This plugin requires munin-server version 1.2.5 or 1.3.3 (or higher).

    on SunOS, Linux and *BSD (i.e. the history is preserved).

    All fields have colours associated with them which reflect the type of
    process (sleeping/idle = blue, running = green, stopped/zombie/dead =
    red, etc.)

CONFIGURATION
    No configuration for this plugin.
